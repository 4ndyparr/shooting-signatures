## about
Soccer Shooting Signatures is a data visualization project based on the *shooting signatures* developed by Peter Beshai for [Buckets](http://buckets.peterbeshai.com), an interactive NBA visualization tool. The idea was to apply the same concept (an at-a-glance view of a shooting performance relative to location) for soccer.

Similarly to basketball, in soccer, *distance* (to the goal) is the single most important location-related factor that explains shooting percentages (check the figure below for a visual demostration), with the other important factor being the *angle* (and it has itself a strong correlation with distance). So I decided to apply the same signature technique to soccer shooting data to see what insights it can bring.
